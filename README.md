### Features
- 25 min study / 5 min break
- music playing in the background
- ***timer is syncronized between all the users***
- ***invite link to get more people to join***
- ***pausing / playing on one browser does that action on all connected browsers***

### Known Issues
- sometimes Chrome has an issue joining a room (seems to have a limit on the number of sockets because it gives the message "waiting for available socket")
- if it takes too long to connect, the time will be off slightly (this can be fixed by doing time syncs periodically between the group but this has not been implemented)
- does not work on most mobile devices but was not meant to be used on one
